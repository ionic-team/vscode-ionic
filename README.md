- Removes `ionic/cordova-builders` from Capacitor projects (usually migrated from Cordova)
- Removes `ionic-cordova-build` and `ionic-cordova-serve` sections in `angular.json` in Capacitor Projects

## Splash Screen and Icons

A splash screen and icon image can be set:

- The package `cordova-res` will be installed as a dev dependency
- Images will be generated by resizing for various iOS and Android sizes
- These images will be included as part the native projects
- Allows setting of [Adaptive Icons](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-assets#adaptive-icons) which are used by Android

## Error Assistant

Detects errors in `swift`, `java`, `typescript`, `eslint`, `jasmine` and `jest` files after operations.

- Opens the place in code where the error occurs
- Allows navigation to `next` and `previous` errors
- Re-runs the operation when you correct the problem and save the file

## Remote Logging

Remote logging will Console logs from your app to the VS Code output window. You can turn this option on in `Settings`.

Note: The remote logging service runs using `http`, so for Android device you will need to update your `capacitor.config.ts` to enable clear text transports: `server: { cleartext: true }`.

## Capacitor Preview

If you click `Run` > `Web` you will notice a QR Code. This can be scanned with the Capacitor Preview mobile application which will launch and run your application. You now have a running application on your mobile device that will reload if you make a code change and save ("Live Reload").

Note: The Capacitor Preview application has a limited set of plugins which will work with your application.

## Nx Support

Detects a Nx workspace and provides a Nx Project selector for `apps`. When an Nx project is selected menu options will reflect what the project is capable of (eg running a native iOS or Android app). The `scripts` section will also include the common Nx commands for `build`, `test`, `lint` and `e2e`.

Note: The extension only provides support for node package upgrades at the root of your Nx workspace.

- [Video of Nx Workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84595830/159509969-70a0c5ed-aebd-4d9d-9691-426675be93f6.mp4)

## Mono Repos in Folders

Detects a workspace where subfolders contain Ionic applications and provides a project selector.

## Npm Workspaces Support

Detects when npm workspaces are used as part of a mono repo and provides a workspace selector.

## pnpm Workspaces Support

Detects when [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) workspaces are used as part of a mono repo and provides a workspace selector.

## Lerna Support

Detects when [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is used as part of a mono repo and provides a workspace selector.

## Yarn Workspaces Support

Detects when Yarn workspaces are used as part of a mono repo and provides a workspace selector.

## Live Reload with HTTPS

The feature (`Settings` > `Use HTTPS`) will create a certificate and serve your application using HTTPS. Instructions to trust the certificate on web, iOS and Android are displayed.

> Note: This feature is currently only available with Angular projects and will temporarily install a plugin due to a quirk with the Android web view not trusting user installed CA Certificates.

## Debugging for Web

For debugging (adding breakpoints, inspecting variables and seeing console logging) use the options under the `Debug` folder.
Debugging for web will launch a separate web browser instance that is debuggable (Google Chrome by Default). You can also choose Microsoft Edge from the `settings` option.

## Debugging for Android

Debugging for Android can be done by first running for Android. Any web view instances found will appear under the `Debug` folder. This allows any in-app browser instances to also be debugged.
Note: When debugging the extension will run a static web server on `http://localhost:80` which is used to serve source map files which allows breakpoints to work correctly in VS Code.

## Debugging for iOS

Debugging for iOS is not supported yet. Use Safari's debugging options documented [here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/troubleshooting/debugging#ios-and-safari).
