# Roadmap

- work without ionic-config.json by looking at project files
- ionic build without ionic cli
- avoid installing ionic cli local
- support for bun

- Run ios - "no devices" error is xcode missing. Show "To run you'll need XCode installed. Do you want to install it?"
- Run Android - Error on no android studio. Show "To run you'll need Android Studio installed...."
- Run Web - Show [Open In Google Chrome, Open In Editor, Open with Nexus]
- Flag packages pull from git with a warning. If they are not pinned to a commit then flag as an error
- Target Mac, Linux & Windows with https://neutralino.js.org/

- Icon for stop task, Icon for restart task
- When package.json is changed then refresh scripts
- Errors not finding code and line number in Angular or some scripts
- Add a shortcut option+R that will re-run the last script run
- When switching between projects - if its a project like a cloudflare worker then open the scripts by default
- With Scripts - have an option to pretty format them in a tree: eg local-db-list-migration, local-db-apply-migration > local-db . list-migration, apply-migration
- If you run "rebuild node modules" on a folder based mono-repo (eg dust-web) then it will fail
- When running do it in the DEBUG CONSOLE!!!!
  - This way interactive things work (like wrangler dev)
  - You get color coding
  - Hopefully error handling is easier

## Studio

- `Welcome page` - show "New Ionic Project", list of recent projects (icons with framework type, name), search bar to find a project
- `Project page`
  - `Develop` - Runs "serve" which will running:
    - Open Browser - Opens a new default web browser
    - Open Mockup Opens a VS Code window with a phone mockup
    - Shows QR Code for Nexus Browser
  - `iOS, Android` - To do `cap run`
  - `Debug Web` - To debug the app in VS Code
  - `Code`
    - Shows list of all components, pages, services etc
    - Has a quick search to find one and opens it on pressing enter
    - Has a keyboard shortcut to flip between `html > css > ts > html`
    - Buttons for new component, page etc
    - `Preview mode` - Render the look and feel of the page / component
  - `Deploy Page`
    - Prepare Android - APK. Great for upload to play store.
    - Prepare iOS - Generates the IPA:
      - Uploads to a deployment server with generate plist and extracted icon, name and branch and version (plus developer)
      - Provides URL which shows a page that can install the IPA / APK
  - `Capabilities Page`
    - List installed dependencies: filter for plugins, framework, other, capabilities, all
    - View as grid (columns for name, version, rating, official badge, recommended badge, upgrade button)
    - View as cards (like current plugins)
    - Capabilities are plugins like "Screen Reader", "Push Notifications"
    - Plugins may be recommended: tagged in a category and type (eg Play Integrity + Security)
    - Idea is that you can drill into say "Security" and see all related Categories with one plugin per category
    - The best rated plugin show as recommended
    - Alternatives are shown as well
    - Option to purchase a plugin: links to purchase url/home page
- `Targets Page`
  - Allows you to turn on/off/rebuild a target
  - Includes `iOS`, `Android`, `PWA`, `Windows`, `Mac`, `Linux`
- `Cool Features`
  - Eliminate `Sync` by syncing when package.json changes or an install happens
  - Eliminate `Build` by tracking latest changed file
  - `Build Watch`
    - Rebuild `www` and continously re-deploy on a change (a slower but more accurate live-deploy)
    - Rebuild to deploy url (equivalent to netlify deploy)
    - Rebuild to live update (live update to a "dev" version of your app that will reload on volume button press)

## PWA

- PWA support for React/Vue
- When display name is changed look for `manifest.webmanifest` and change name/shortname
- When PWA support is added set the `name`/`shortname`
- PWA settings page needs `theme_color` and `background_color`
- When setting `theme_color` set in index.html `<meta name="theme-color" content="#F61067">`
- Favicon generator - check `@capacitor/assets` will generate it
- PWA splash screens?

## Capacitor 6

- Detect and migrate
- Fix: The bundledWebRuntime configuration option has been deprecated. Can be safely deleted.
- Enable beta with "Experimental Features" option

## Features

- Add Type Coverage: https://github.com/plantain-00/type-coverage

- Generate twitter and og metatags
- Generate social and favicon
- Avoid sharp and @capacitor/assets
- Angular projects that use IonicModule (eg `import { IonicModule } from '@ionic/angular';`) and `@ionic/angular/standalone` or `import { send } from 'ionicons/icons';` will break. Check code for it?
- Customers dont really understand the upgrade process in packages/plugins - looking in the "plugins" windows:
- Need to recommend upgrading minor versions of Capacitor on a regular basis (eg monthly)
- Need to recommend upgrading minor versions of Capacitor plugins on a regular basis (eg monthly)
- Angular standalone templates when a component is added (eg `ion-header`) will error until imported correctly. Add an auto-import feature?
- For Capacitor 5 check deployment target is ios >= 13
- Find: Search for all pages, components, routes etc and put in a search box to speed up opens
- Alt+T: Toggle between html/scss and ts

- Starters for Angular add `settings.json` in `.vscode` with {

```json
  "typescript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns": [
    "@ionic/angular/common",
    "@ionic/angular"
  ],
```

}
Check `main.ts` for `provideIonicAngular` and apply this if missing

- Update docs on capacitorjs.com
- Recommendation for experimental migration to Angular standalone components
- Recommendation for experimental migration to Angular built-in control flow syntax
- Recommendation of migration to @ionic/angular (major versions) and link to migration doc

- eslint-plugin-unused-imports

- Show git remote url somewhere (`git config --get remote.origin.url`)
- (feat) Debugger for iOS (add breakpoints, inspection etc)
- (feat) info.plist editing
- (1) Getting devices takes some time to run the first time. Make sure logging goes to Output window and if taking > 5 seconds then give user feedback that it may take time
- (2) If you sync but the build didn't work then show suitable error (or trigger build)
- (2) If a project has not been built and you try running on ios/android it could build for you beforehand
- (2) Show gotchas page for Angular migration x to x+1
- (2) On Web projects that are Angular based hook up dist or configured folder

- (fix) For a regular Angular project that is in a subfolder it reports not finding www folder when running npx cap copy. But dist exists and the extension can correct that in capacitor.config.ts. The dist folder may be separated by app too so dist/my-app may be where the index.html is located

## Key Bindings

- ALT+X for XCode
- ALT+A for Android Studio
- ALT+S for Sync

## NX

- NX 15, Sync not working
- NX 15, Run iOS/Android not working

- (fix) - Add removal of `@jcesarmobile/ssl-skip` as recommendation

## Android Trust Issues

- Android ([info](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/2147))
- May need an intermediate cert ([info](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl))

## Linting

- Recommendation for enhanced linting
- Check eslint.json and show dialog with unchecked rules
- Each rule has name and explanation and link to example
- On checking a new rule run linting
- Show count of lint errors and provide option to lint fix
- Make sure next > prev work for linting
- (8) Amp eslint rules to 11: using https://gist.github.com/dtarnawsky/7c42cec330443c7093976136286b5473

## App Flow

- Listing recent Appflow builds and allowing users to sideload the artifacts from those builds onto their simulators/devices (lots of potential cert issues with iOS here)
- Augmenting the New Project functionality to create the app in appflow and begin with the project linked, similar to the Ionic App Wizard
- Starting an appflow trial directly from the extension… thinking a 1-click experience to install AC/IV/etc

## Ditch Ionic CLI

- Check `package.json` for missing `name` and `version` and set if needed
- Avoid `ionic init` and instead guess best npm run script based on `package.json` having React,Vue,Nuxt etc.
- Guess `dist` folder based on `package.json`
- Guess IP Address, Port based on logged output

## Project Config

- Bundle ID
- Display Name
- Version Number
- Build Number
- Splash (screen, dark, icon, icon background, icon foreground)

- Android Manifest
- Info.plist
- Plugins
- Packages
- Settings + Advanced Settings

- Security Audit
- Statistics
- Export

- Remove "check for minor updates"

## PWA Helper

Help user to install a PWA using a tooltip

- Chrome browser: show link to install app icon and instructions
- Safari: show share button and "Add to dock"
- Windows, iOS, Android

- Parameters:
  - Time used: (seconds). How long does the user need to use the app before the install option appears. Default 5 mins
  - Messaging: allow message displayed to be customized (eg language)
- Script tag to include in index.html or npm package
