# Roadmap

- TODO: add pwa integration
- Fix "undefined" tooltip on Android
- Fix: The bundledWebRuntime configuration option has been deprecated. Can be safely deleted.
- Improve security audit to show which direct dependencies are affected by indirect vunerabilities
- Generate twitter and og metatags
- Generate social and favicon
- Avoid sharp and @capacitor/assets
- Angular projects that use IonicModule (eg `import { IonicModule } from '@ionic/angular';`) and `@ionic/angular/standalone` or `import { send } from 'ionicons/icons';` will break. Check code for it?
- Customers dont really understand the upgrade process in packages/plugins - looking in the "plugins" windows:
- Need to recommend upgrading minor versions of Capacitor on a regular basis (eg monthly)
- Need to recommend upgrading minor versions of Capacitor plugins on a regular basis (eg monthly)
- Angular standalone templates when a component is added (eg `ion-header`) will error until imported correctly. Add an auto-import feature?
- For Capacitor 5 check deployment target is ios >= 13
- Find: Search for all pages, components, routes etc and put in a search box to speed up opens
- Alt+T: Toggle between html/scss and ts

- Starters for Angular add `settings.json` in `.vscode` with {

```json
  "typescript.preferences.autoImportFileExcludePatterns": [
    "@ionic/angular/common",
    "@ionic/angular"
  ],
```

}
Check `main.ts` for `provideIonicAngular` and apply this if missing

## 1.60

- As --force is used with Angular migrations there may be peer dependency errors that need resolution afterwards. Need a peer dep resolver.
- Update docs on capacitorjs.com
- Recommendation for experimental migration to Angular standalone components
- Recommendation for experimental migration to Angular built-in control flow syntax
- Recommendation of migration to @ionic/angular (major versions) and link to migration doc

- eslint-plugin-unused-imports

## Important

- Use https://github.com/eric-horodyski/chrome117-custom-scheme-bug and check for custom scheme and add warning

## Plugin Explorer

- (feat) Add Capacitor plugin to the starters

* (feat) Add PWA to targets
* (feat) Add Electron to targets

## Bugs

- React Vite can write Network: rather than External:

* Use HTTPS on windows doesnt work

- Export Statistics on React v7 projects no longer works due to source maps
  You need to add `build: { sourcemap: true }`, to `vite.config.ts`
- (feat) Run->iOS - if windows then prompt that "This feature requires a Mac"
- (feat) Open in Xcode - Similarly requires a Mac

* (feat) Use Https - if openssl is not installed show an error message
* (fix) If upgrading/changing a package then make sure dev server is stopped
* (fix) When running on web for regular Angular app it doesn't launch the browser

## Features

- (feat) Yarn 3 support
- (feat) if @angular/core >= 14 and no .eslintrc.json or exists(tslint) then recommend eslint migration:
- (feat) Use https://stackoverflow.com/a/22040887 for Android and dont use Julio's SSL plugin

* (feat) Open in Editor as web site (click near QR Code)

- Preview App - Rotate device
- Preview App - Dark/Light mode (add 'dark' to class of body)
- (feat) Preview in Editor - Show Device Name with Check mark
- (feat) Editor preview - option to rotate
- (feat) Editor preview - dark / light mode switch

- Show git remote url somewhere (`git config --get remote.origin.url`)
- (feat) Debugger for iOS (add breakpoints, inspection etc)
- (feat) info.plist editing
- (feat) Twitter to RSS feed - pull news into plugin ??
- (1) Getting devices takes some time to run the first time. Make sure logging goes to Output window and if taking > 5 seconds then give user feedback that it may take time
- (2) If you sync but the build didn't work then show suitable error (or trigger build)
- (2) If a project has not been built and you try running on ios/android it could build for you beforehand
- (2) Show gotchas page for Angular migration x to x+1
- (2) On Web projects that are Angular based hook up dist or configured folder
- (16) If using say @capacitor/camera then allow editing of info.plist and Android permissions (highlight if empty)
- (4) When running for web, if you close the browser, a button for "Open Browser" should allow opening it again.
- (8) Show preview as soon as "Run on Web" is clicked and show progress until app is ready
- (4) Highlight dev dependencies in some way
- (4) Detect if Android Studio not installed
- (perf) Only run capacitor config commands when "Configuration" is expanded

## Other

- If local address is turned on then show warning on start that Nexus wont work ?
- (feat) Coding standards: Review
  https://github.com/ionic-team/prettier-config
  https://github.com/ionic-team/eslint-config
- (fix) On a Stencil project selecting run in editor doesn't seem to work
- (fix) For a regular Angular project that is in a subfolder it reports not finding www folder when running npx cap copy. But dist exists and the extension can correct that in capacitor.config.ts. The dist folder may be separated by app too so dist/my-app may be where the index.html is located

## Key Bindings

- ALT+X for XCode
- ALT+A for Android Studio
- ALT+S for Sync

## NX

- NX 15, Sync not working
- NX 15, Run iOS/Android not working
- In NX, if project.json is missing a name then add name to it
- In NX, if running the Podfile will fail (seems to be relative node_modules folder issue)
- (bug) Package reconciliation (from root and project)
- (feat) Needs lint, test and e2e nx tasks added (assuming @nxtend/ionic-angular)
- (feat) Detect missing @nxtend/ionic-angular or @nxtend/ionic-react. Option to add
- (feat) Detect missing @nxtend/capacitor. Option to add
- Starters for NX?

## Pin Dependencies

- (4) Recommend applying exact version numbers in package.json rather than ~ or ^ or next

## Ionitron / ChatGPT

- Add a "Ask Ionitron" button when error dialogs are shown
- Give brief that Ionitron can give solutions to errors but requires Chat GPT API Key
- Write Chat GPT output to the output window and show dialog for next prompt
- Add "Ask Ionitron" in the task list

## View Style

Alterantive visual web views:

- Run iOS, Android - Show lists of devices and option to run as live reload
- Splash, Icon, Settings - Named Configuration allow visuals
- Support - Link for feedback, framework, each of the components
- Angular - New components, Show existing pages, components, and settings files

## QR Preview

- Button on Toolbar for Build
- Button on Toolbar for Run Web, Run iOS, Run Android
- Click QR Code to display "Use the 'Capacitor View' App to open this application

## Certificates

- Certificate setup for Windows (for Live Reload with HTTPS)
- Handle scenario where openssl is not installed
- SSL options for non-angular projects
- Add document on Live Reload with https
- (fix) - Add removal of `@jcesarmobile/ssl-skip` as recommendation

## Android Trust Issues

- Android ([info](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/2147))
- May need an intermediate cert ([info](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl))

## Linting

- Recommendation for enhanced linting
- Check eslint.json and show dialog with unchecked rules
- Each rule has name and explanation and link to example
- On checking a new rule run linting
- Show count of lint errors and provide option to lint fix
- Make sure next > prev work for linting
- (8) Amp eslint rules to 11: using https://gist.github.com/dtarnawsky/7c42cec330443c7093976136286b5473

## App Flow

- Listing recent Appflow builds and allowing users to sideload the artifacts from those builds onto their simulators/devices (lots of potential cert issues with iOS here)
- Augmenting the New Project functionality to create the app in appflow and begin with the project linked, similar to the Ionic App Wizard
- Starting an appflow trial directly from the extensionâ€¦ thinking a 1-click experience to install AC/IV/etc

## Ditch Ionic CLI

- Check `package.json` for missing `name` and `version` and set if needed
- Avoid `ionic init` and instead guess best npm run script based on `package.json` having React,Vue,Nuxt etc.
- Guess `dist` folder based on `package.json`
- Guess IP Address, Port based on logged output

## Project Config

- Bundle ID
- Display Name
- Version Number
- Build Number
- Splash (screen, dark, icon, icon background, icon foreground)

- Android Manifest
- Info.plist
- Plugins
- Packages
- Settings + Advanced Settings

- Security Audit
- Statistics
- Export

- Remove "check for minor updates"
